                    <p style="line-height: 2; text-align: justify;">The project began in 2017 and after some test runs, Next2you was brought to life in 2019 by Ibezim Chike, a Computer Science
                        graduate from Paul university. The need for next2you arose when Chike observed that it was really difficult for skilled professionals and artisans to get a job even in an
                        environment where there are prospective customers. The amount spent by individuals to find skilled professionals was another reason the platform was created. Either people were
                        getting sham jobs or the bills where just too high. Chike brought the project to life by creating a platform where individuals can easily get connected to artisans and
                        professionals close to them, saving them the resourses they'd have rather spent in searching for those services farther while also giving skilled artisans the customer base
                        they need for growth and sustenance.</p>
