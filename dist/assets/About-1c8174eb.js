The need for GoXupport arose when Chike observed that it was really difficult for skilled professionals and artisans to get a job even in an environment where there are prospective customers. The amount spent by individuals to find skilled professionals was another reason the platform was created. Either people were getting sham jobs or the bills where just too high. Chike brought the project to life by creating a platform where individuals can easily get connected to artisans and professionals close to them, saving them the resourses they&#39;d have rather spent in searching for those services farther while also giving skilled artisans the customer base they need for growth and sustenance. </p></div></div></section></div>',1),f={__name:"About",setup(c){return(d,p)=>(i(),a(r,null,[e(t),l,e(s)],64))}};export{f as default};
